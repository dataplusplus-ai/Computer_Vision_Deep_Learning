# Computer_Vision_Deep_Learning
Deep learning algorithms for computer vision problems such as image classification, clustering of images, object detection,face recognition,
and drawing boundaries for objects(masks) in images.
The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures are Resnet, VGG, densenet.
The open source libraries for deep learning Tensorflow and Keras in jupyter notebooks are used.
